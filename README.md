baseflight
==========

32 bit fork of the MultiWii RC flight controller firmware

Added in this fork :

 * ["ACRO RATE"](https://github.com/multiwii/baseflight/pull/29) is added to enable a second expo/rate while flying. This allow a mild version of expo/rate for precision then another set for acro.
 * [Adjusted sensor fusion calculation](https://github.com/multiwii/baseflight/pull/54)
